# weather_api
It is a website used to know weather of different location in the world by just typing the name of the city.
In this i basically used an API to fetch data of diffrent location and used advanced javascricpt in this process
In backend i have used nodeJs and express js to route the files..
and also i used handlebars as a template engine..
